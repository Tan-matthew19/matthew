# Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
Overview :
This project provides an interactive air quality dashboard built with Streamlit. It compares air pollution levels (PM2.5 and PM10) in two locations: Wanliu and Wanshouxigong, based on historical data. The dashboard also visualizes correlations between pollutants and environmental factors (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity) and explores how temperature affects nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations.

Features
PM2.5 & PM10 Levels Comparison: Explore time-series plots of particulate matter levels over a user-selected date range.
Correlation Heatmaps: Analyze relationships between air quality parameters, such as pollutants and weather conditions.
Scatter Plots: Visualize how temperature impacts NO2 levels.
Date Filters: Customize the analysis by selecting specific date ranges using an interactive sidebar.
