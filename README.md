# Air Quality Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This project presents an interactive air quality dashboard using Streamlit. It compares PM2.5 and PM10 pollution levels between Wanliu and Wanshouxigong, based on historical data. The dashboard includes time-series visualizations, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots to analyze how environmental factors (e.g., temperature) impact pollution levels.

## Features
PM2.5 & PM10 Levels Comparison: Time-series plots for both locations over a chosen date range.
Correlation Heatmaps: Visualize relationships between pollutants and weather.
Scatter Plots: Analyze the impact of temperature on NO2 levels.
Interactive Date Filters: Customize analysis by date range.
